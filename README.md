# [PII](https://lookup.ninja)
Source code of the Public Instances Index website for Lookup Ninja.

## IMPORTANT!
__AS OF 8 NOVEMBER 2021, this is an archived project__. We are in the process of drawing up plans to reintroduce Lookup Ninja as a DNS-lookup only service, or as a WHOIS/DNS tool which requires login, thus, the lookup.ninja domain will be used. We may introduce a Public Instances Index elsewhere, at which point we will un-archive this project. _Thank you!_
